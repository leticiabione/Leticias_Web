                    Our minds can me very lousy at times. This happens when we don't understand what is happening. Both inside and outside of us. Serenity comes not from the circumstances around us, but from the connection made between them and our emotions. Certain readings can help us understand how our mind functions in relation to the body. The deeper this understanding, the stronger the connection. These are subjects that human beings have been studying for thousands of years. It is incredibly helpful to be able to enter some of the greatest minds in history and use them as a way to get to know yourself better.
