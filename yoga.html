    WHAT IS YOGA?
</h1>
    <h2>
        Yoga is a mind and body practice with a 5,000-year history in ancient Indian philosophy. It is a group of physical, mental, and spiritual practices or disciplines which originated in ancient India.
The word "yoga" literally means "union". Yoga is essentially, "that which brings you to reality.‚Äù 
<br>
<br> The spiritual sense of the word <i>yoga</i> first arises in <i>Epic Sanskrit (Indian epic poetry)</i>, in the second half of the 1st millennium BCE, and is associated with the philosophical system presented in the <i>Yoga Sutras of the Patanjali</i>, a collection of Sanskrit sutras (or aphorisims: concise memorable expression of a general truth or principle) on the theory and practice of yoga. It has the chief aim of uniting the human spirit with the divine spirit.
<br>
<br> There is a broad variety of yoga schools, practices, and goals in <i>Hinduism</i>, <i>Buddhism</i>, and <i>Jainism</i>. The ultimate goal of Yoga is <i>Moksha</i> (liberation), although the exact form this takes depends on the philosophical or theological system with which it is conjugated.
Various styles of yoga combine physical postures, breathing techniques, and meditation or relaxation.

    WHERE TO START?
</h1>
    <h2>
        The number one rule is: you start with your decision. 
        <br>
        <br>It doesn't matter how much you know about yoga, how athletic and flexible you are, or your level of awareness of your body for that matter. You just need to start your practice and build from where you are. Be persistent and disciplined with your practice, pushing through the initial confusing stages if it feels foreign to you. With time, your understanding will expand.
        <br>
        <br>With that being said, here is a yoga YouTube channel which I really enjoy. Adriene, the yogi, has a soothing voice and likable personality that helps you relax and follow through understanding the movements.
