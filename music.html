                THE POWER OF MUSIC
            </h1>
                <h2>
                    One of the most dramatic effects of music's power is the induction of trance states, which have been described by ethnomusicologists in nearly every culture. Science all but confirms that humans are hard-wired to respond to music. Numerous scientific and psychological studies have shown that music can lift our moods, combat depression, improve blood flow in ways similar to statins, lower levels of stress-related hormones such as cortisol, and ease pain.
                <br>
                <br> Music mimics patterns dancing in a perfectly synchronized manner, speaking to how we operate in the world. Beautiful music is something to aspire to. With that being said, I will leave you with what Dr. Jordan B. Peterson once said about music. 
                <br>
                <br> “I think that music is a genuine mystery. It's one of the transcendental phenomena we all have access to. It's like looking into the night sky. Or at the Grand Canyon. There's something about it that seems to speak about things that are beyond the mundane. It also seems to me that music
                    reliably speaks to people of meaning. And that there are... And that the reason music plays such a popular, powerful role in our culture is because the meaning that music speaks of is beyond rational critique. And we're very rational, and we're very intelligent. And so, we've been able to make intellectual hash out of most of the things that had traditionally offered people a grounded sense of meaning. But because music is beyond rational criticism, it seems to have been able to retain its experiential connection with transcendent meaning despise the fact our rational mind has destroyed everything else that's transcendental.”
