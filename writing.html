                    Writing exercises are incredibly beneficial for our mental health. Writing helps you sort out your thoughts, allowing you to better understand them and your emotions. Journaling is an ancient practice long known to be helpful in our lives. Yet, it is not nearly as valued as it should, due to the fact that it is regarded as a clich√© or a childish activity by many. 

Writing about your daily life, your past, and your aspirations will make such daily abstract thoughts more concrete. Information will not be lost by your mere human memory that is so powerfully affected by emotion.
